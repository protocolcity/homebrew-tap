  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      BluePrint suite is installed (ProtocolCity kit).

      Next — create or adopt a workspace:

        blueprint setup
        # setup offers: keep running after you close the terminal? (macOS)

      Serve (engines start by default when a root is set):

        blueprint serve --root <your-workspace>

      Keep running after you close the terminal (macOS login LaunchAgent):

        blueprint service install --root <your-workspace>

      After brew upgrade/install, post_install runs `blueprint stop`, which
      unloads the suite (and login agent) so a deleted Cellar path is not
      kept alive. Restore always-on:

        blueprint service start
        # if you never installed the agent:
        blueprint service install --root <your-workspace>
        # one-shot (no login agent):
        blueprint serve --root <your-workspace>

      Remove (stops suite/engines, then keep or delete workspace files):

        blueprint uninstall --app
    EOS
  end
end
